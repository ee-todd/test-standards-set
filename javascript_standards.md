# JavaScript Coding Standards

## 1. **Code Structure**
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Organize code into reusable modules or components.
- Follow the single responsibility principle (SRP) for functions and classes.

## 2. **Syntax and Formatting**
- Use camelCase for variable and function names, and PascalCase for class names.
- Use `const` for constants and `let` for variables that may change; avoid `var`.
- Prefer template literals (`\``) over string concatenation for better readability.
- Use strict equality (`===`) to avoid type coercion.

## 3. **Code Style**
- Indent using 2 spaces or a tab (be consistent across the project).
- End statements with semicolons (`;`) for clarity and to avoid ambiguity.
- Use single quotes (`'`) for strings unless double quotes are required.

## 4. **Error Handling**
- Use `try...catch` blocks for error-prone operations.
- Validate inputs and handle edge cases gracefully.
- Log meaningful error messages for debugging.

## 5. **Comments and Documentation**
- Write comments to explain the "why" of the code, not the "what."
- Use JSDoc-style comments for functions and complex blocks.
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.

## 6. **Best Practices**
- Avoid global variables; use closures or modules instead.
- Write unit tests for critical functions and components.
- Use linting tools (e.g., ESLint) to enforce coding standards.
- Minimize the use of inline JavaScript in HTML for better separation of concerns.

## 7. **Version Control**
- Commit changes with descriptive messages.
- Follow a branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow) for version control.

Following these guidelines ensures that your JavaScript code is maintainable, readable, and scalable.
