# General Coding Standards

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Use camelCase for variables and functions.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Constants should be written in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.

## 2. Code Organization
- Group related functions and variables together.
- Separate code into modules or files based on functionality.
- Use comments to document the purpose of each module or file.

## 3. Indentation and Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces per level).
- Limit line length to 80-100 characters.
- Add a newline at the end of each file.

## 4. Documentation
- Write clear and concise comments explaining why the code exists, not just what it does.
- Use docstrings or comments to describe the purpose and usage of functions and classes.

## 5. Error Handling
- Validate inputs and handle errors gracefully.
- Use exceptions for error handling where supported by the language.
- Log errors with sufficient context to aid debugging.

## 6. Version Control
- Use version control (e.g., Git) for all projects.
- Commit changes with meaningful and descriptive messages.
- Use feature branches for new work and merge to main via pull requests.

## 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for critical functions and components.
- Aim for high test coverage to ensure code reliability.
- Use automated testing tools where possible.

## 8. Security
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive data like passwords or API keys.
- Use secure practices for handling user input to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## 9. Code Reviews
- Review code for readability, maintainability, and correctness before merging.
- Provide constructive feedback during code reviews.
- Address feedback promptly and thoroughly.

## 10. Performance
- Optimize code for efficiency when necessary, but prioritize readability and maintainability first.
- Use profiling tools to identify and resolve bottlenecks.
- Avoid premature optimization unless performance is critical.
